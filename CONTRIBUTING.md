###  ** How to Contribute **

## In Templates Folder :

###  you can create files and add boiler plate code for a particular language ( for ex: javascript, reactjs projects , mongodb etc) or cheatsheets/synataxes too.



## In Components Folder:

### In this folder you can create files and add components ( for example : login page/ sign up pages in any language, or portfolio or any of that kind in any language)




<h4>Everything is your choice, just pick one folder at one time!!!</h4>

## NOTE:

<h2> Within the templates/components folder create and  Name your files with your name ( Your-name.html or Your-name.css) so they are easy for me to keep track of :)</h2>
